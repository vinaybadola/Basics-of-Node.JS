!  Express.js is a web app framework that provides you with a simple API to build websites
? web apps and backend. It facilitates the rapid development of Node based web applications.
? Following are some of the core features of Express Framework-

** Allows to set up middlewares to respond to HTTP request.
** Defines a routing table which is used to perform different actions based on HTTP method and URL.
** Allows to dynamically render HTML pages based on passing arguments to templates.

! Another simple definiton- 
** Express.js is a Node.js web application server framework, which is specially designed for building single-page,
**multi-page and hybrid web app.


//! syntax =app.get(root , callback)
app.get("/" , (req, res) =>{

})

? The callback function has 2 parameters , request(req) and response(res). The request object(req) represents the HTTP request 
? and has properties for the request query string, parameters , body, HTTP headers, etc.

** Similarly,the response object represents the HTTP response that the express app sends when it receives an HTTP request.

! What are Routes?
*Routing determine the way in which an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint.
*For example, a client can make a GET, POST, PUT or DELETE http request for various URL such as the ones shown below;

http://localhost:3000/Books
http://localhost:3000/Students

! Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched

? General syntax= app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)

wherein,

1) app is an instance of the express module

2) METHOD is an HTTP request method (GET, POST, PUT or DELETE)

3) PATH is a path on the server.

4) HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.
